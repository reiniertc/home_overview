# home_overview
A complete overview of every room in your house in a single card

This is a custom component with the goal of providing you an overview of you entire house in one card. 
It allows you to define a table with a single or multiple columns and rows.
In every cell you can:
- display the title of a room
- display the current light, by filling the background with the primary color
- display the temperature on the second row
- display the current playing song album art as a background
- display the status of a sensor on the bottom row
- assign a tap_action, hold_action and double_tap_action

The cells wil allways appear square. The appearance is highly configurable:
- border-radius
- opacity when light_entity is off
- no background color when no title is provided
- text size
- line-height
- vertical spacing between cells
- horizontal spacing between cells

# First example - entire house
